### 2026 Update

This game was made with a really old version of the [IN2](https://github.com/benjamin-t-brown/in2) engine; a dialog tree game engine that I authored 2017.  This was the debut game for that engine.  The game itself had some rounds on social media but wans't that successful, and neither was the engine.  Despite that, the engine was at least useful to myself, althought it has evolved to serve various projects of mine (to a point where you could argue it's identity as a ship of theseus), and ultimately I decided that IN2 is officially deprecated with the advent of [Carcer's implementation of it](https://github.com/benjamin-t-brown/carcer-wayward-world).  For better or for worse, I don't have the original development files for this game in regards to that old-ass engine, so updates to it are not likely aside from a few typos here and there.  That's probably a good thing.  I've grown a lot since writing this game, but even still I come back to it from time to time with fondness.  This game is aged and flawed, but I still like it, and I hope you do too!
